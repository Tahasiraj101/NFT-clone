            <h3>THE BATHROOM</h3>
        <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives. <br><br>

            Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter. <br><br>
            
            We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
